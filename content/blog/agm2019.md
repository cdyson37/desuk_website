Our Annual General Meeting 2019 took place in the Civil Service Club, London on the 27th April.

Congratulations to our newly-elected committee, consisting of:

* Chairman: Michael Coates
* Vice-chairman: Roger Boyes
* Treasurer: Grant Elliot
* Secretary: Quentin Bryar
* Meetings: Antony Pepper
* Other members:
  * Frank Griffith (Artistic adviser)
  * Patrick Olsen (Blue Light editor)
  * Charlie Dyson
  * Gareth Evans
  * George Duncan
  * John Lucas
  * Pedro Cravinho

After the meeting, Roger Boyes presented on "Duke and Mingus" with a varied playlist of collaborations and interpretations.

Of course, such a talk could only conclude with Duke and Mingus' collaboration on the album **Money Jungle**. Roger chose a particularly robust **Caravan** as our closer.
