## The Jazz Centre
Roy Tresadern was on hand to give an introduction to the UK Jazz Centre at Southend-on-Sea. They have a fantastic programme of events coming up and some great exhibits. More details at [thejazzcentreuk.co.uk] (http://thejazzcentreuk.co.uk/)

## Duke and Mingus
After the meeting, Roger Boyes presented on "Duke and Mingus" with a varied playlist of collaborations and interpretations.

Of course, such a talk could only conclude with Duke and Mingus' collaboration on the album **Money Jungle**. Roger chose a particularly robust **Caravan** as our closer.
