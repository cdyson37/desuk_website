[Dr John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._John) (Malcolm John Rebennack Jr.) passed away on June 6, 2019. Among his extensive discography he leaves us an album of Ellington covers, [Duke Elegant](https://www.allmusic.com/album/duke-elegant-mw0000603953). Here's a fun one. Check out an fascinating reworking of [The Flaming Sword](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhCf8GSVsfM) on the same album.
