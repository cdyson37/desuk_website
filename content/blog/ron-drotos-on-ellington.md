Spotted over at Ron Drotos' wesbsite: [The Beginner's Guide To Duke Ellington](https://keyboardimprov.com/the-beginners-guide-to-duke-ellington/). A nice introductory article with some good selections. One to share with Ellington newcomers.

There are a few more Ellington-related blog posts on the site, including [the surprising similarity between Duke Ellington, Keith Jarrett, and Elton John](https://keyboardimprov.com/the-surprising-similarity-between-duke-ellington-keith-jarrett-and-elton-john), as well as guides to playing some of the songs. We look forward to more!
