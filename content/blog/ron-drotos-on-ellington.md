Spotted over at Ron Drotos' wesbsite: [The Beginner's Guide To Duke Ellington](https://keyboardimprov.com/the-beginners-guide-to-duke-ellington/). A nice introductory article with some good selections. One to share with Ellington newcomers.

Ron told us:

> I got on board the Ellington train in the early 1980s, when I was 17-18 years
> old. My piano teacher [Billy
> Taylor](https://keyboardimprov.com/the-jazz-pianists-ultimate-guide-to-the-real-book-table-of-contents/i-wish-i-knew-how-it-would-feel-to-be-free-from-the-jazz-pianists-ultimate-guide-to-the-real-book/)
> had known Ellington and Strayhorn and used to make me cassettes of
> out-of-print albums of theirs.

There are a few more Ellington-related blog posts on the site, including [the surprising similarity between Duke Ellington, Keith Jarrett, and Elton John](https://keyboardimprov.com/the-surprising-similarity-between-duke-ellington-keith-jarrett-and-elton-john), as well as guides to playing some of the songs. We look forward to more!
