Running out of Ellington (or Jazz in general) to listen to? Here are a few suggestions from around the web:

* First and foremost, catch up with our *Uptown Lockdown* broadcasts at https://www.pscp.tv/AP64740207/ - not to be missed!
* [Jazz Times: 10 Very late Ellington Albums](https://jazztimes.com/features/lists/jazztimes-10-very-late-ellington-albums/)
* Terry Teachout's two lists of Ellingtonia: the [first](https://www.artsjournal.com/aboutlastnight/2013/07/tt-ive-got-a-little-list-i.html) a sort of greatest hits, the [second](https://www.artsjournal.com/aboutlastnight/2013/07/tt-ive-got-a-little-list-ii.html) less well known tracks that deserve a bit more listening.
* Duke appearing on [What's My Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS4wjBCS3q4) in 1953
* A rather haunting version of [Lush Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldGLgFJMj_4) with Ella Fitzgerald
* A *Soundie* of [It Don't Mean A Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDQpZT3GhDg)
* [Good Queen Bess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6rro3rTiCs) (largely because it's stuck in your webmaster's head)
* The Jazz Centre UK has been publishing general interest Jazz playlists, one per decade from the 20s onwards, as well as their own Ellington playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/205j0la1ig5idbd08ogaaneca?si=HYTp2NECQpaWUdA5NzCE6w).
