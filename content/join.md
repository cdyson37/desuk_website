# Why Join?

Members receive a copy of our acclaimed magazine *Blue Light* four times a year.

By joining you'll also help the society's activities:

* Research for *Blue Light*
* Our broadcasts of *Uptown Lockdown*
* Supporting projects related to Ellingtonia, such as conferences and public concerts
* Public meetings and listening sessions

# Join up!

An annual membership costs £25 for UK residents and includes all four copies of *Blue Light* published that year (even if you join late in the year).

The fee for overseas members is £35 to cover the cost of international postage, and is otherwise identical to UK membership.

Overseas members may choose to receive *Blue Light* electronically rather than via post, in which case the fee is reduced to £25.
