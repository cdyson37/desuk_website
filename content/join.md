* Public meetings and listening sessions

# Join up!

## UK Membership

An annual membership costs £25 for UK residents and includes all four copies of *Blue Light* published that year (even if you join late in the year).

## Overseas Membership

The fee for overseas members is £35 to cover the cost of international postage, and is otherwise identical to UK membership.

Overseas members may choose to receive *Blue Light* electronically rather than via post, in which case the fee is reduced to £25:
