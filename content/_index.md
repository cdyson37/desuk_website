# Welcome to DESUK

The Duke Ellington Society UK's purpose is to further the study, appreciation and dissemination of the music of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington.

We meet regularly in London to listen and socialise, and new arrivals are always welcome.

Our house publication [Blue Light]({{<relref blue_light>}}) is released quarterly. The content is wide ranging and we are fortunate to have amongst our members jazz authors, journalists and critics, and equally fortunate to have many enthusiastic members who, because of their own deep interest, have become expert in particular niches of Ellingtonia.

## DESUK Live Broadcast: Uptown Lockdown

Regular programming is currently paused, but you can catch up with any episodes you missed [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq3QqJgdSJwk4nlmnnaH42Q/).
