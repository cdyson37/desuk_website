# Welcome to DESUK

The Duke Ellington Society UK's purpose is to further the study, appreciation and dissemination of the music of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington.

We meet regularly in London to listen and socialise, and new arrivals are always welcome.

Our house publication [Blue Light]({{<relref blue_light>}}) is released quarterly. The content is wide ranging and we are fortunate to have amongst our members jazz authors, journalists and critics, and equally fortunate to have many enthusiastic members who, because of their own deep interest, have become expert in particular niches of Ellingtonia.

# Urgent: New Treasurer Required

An important notice from our Chairman:

> Due to the onset of ill-health, our Treasurer - Grant Elliot - has been
obliged to advise that he will no longer be able to continue his duties in
future.
>
> An insert in the last issue of blue light requesting volunteer(s) for the role
produced no results.
>
> So again I am writing, to  all members, to request any suitably experienced
person(s) to urgently consider taking on this important position.
>
> If you would like an outline of the duties involved please <a
href="mailto:desuk@dukeellington.org.uk">contact us</a>.
>
> Once again i would emphasise the urgency and importance of this call for
assistance. Quite frankly, and with great sadness, I need to suggest that if we
are unable to appoint a suitable person, then in all probability desuk will be
unable to operate in future.
