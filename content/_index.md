# Welcome to DESUK

The Duke Ellington Society UK's purpose is to further the study, appreciation and dissemination of the music of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington.

We meet regularly in London to listen and socialise, and new arrivals are always welcome.

Our house publication [Blue Light]({{<relref blue_light>}}) is released quarterly. The content is wide ranging and we are fortunate to have amongst our members jazz authors, journalists and critics, and equally fortunate to have many enthusiastic members who, because of their own deep interest, have become expert in particular niches of Ellingtonia.

## DESUK Live Broadcast: Uptown Lockdown

Our live show is currently paused for the summer, but you can catch up with any episodes you missed [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq3QqJgdSJwk4nlmnnaH42Q/).

For more details on how to view and participate, or to make a donation to support the show, are on the [Uptown Lockdown]({{<relref uptown_lockdown>}}) page.

## 2021 AGM

Unfortunately we were unable to hold an AGM in 2020 due to the Covid-19
pandemic. The DESUK committee is keeping the situation under review, and will
aim to organise a physical AGM in the second half of 2021 if it is safe and
practical for our members to attend.

A provisional date for the AGM is Saturday the 16th of October 2021 in central
London. We will inform our members closer to the time, via Blue Light and this
website, if this can go ahead.
