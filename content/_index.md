# Welcome to DESUK

The Duke Ellington Society UK's purpose is to further the study, appreciation and dissemination of the music of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington.

We meet regularly in London to listen and socialise, and new arrivals are always welcome.

Our house publication [Blue Light]({{<relref blue_light>}}) is released quarterly. The content is wide ranging and we are fortunate to have amongst our members jazz authors, journalists and critics, and equally fortunate to have many enthusiastic members who, because of their own deep interest, have become expert in particular niches of Ellingtonia.

<!--
## Next meeting

... will be in 2020! Happy New Year from us and watch this space.

## 2020 AGM

We will also feature *The Mooche*, *Clarinet Melodrama* and Billy Strayhorn's harrowing *Blood Count.*

> be performing Duke Ellington's Shakespeare suite "Such Sweet Thunder" at
> St George's Guildhall - on St George's Day, Shakespeare's birthday.

> 2015 and we are pleased to revive this suite, with guest performers
> including Bob Hunt on trombone, for King's Lynn.
