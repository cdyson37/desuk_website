# Welcome to DESUK

The Duke Ellington Society UK's purpose is to further the study, appreciation
and dissemination of the music of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington. It is
based in the United Kingdom, but membership is open to everyone.

In ordinary times we meet regularly in London to listen and socialise, and
new arrivals always welcome. During the Covid-19 pandemic we've had to
suspend these meetings, but the society's social aspect continues under the
auspices of Uptown Lockdown (see below).

## Our Magazine: Blue Light

Our house publication [Blue Light]({{<relref blue_light>}}) is released
to members quarterly. A substantial publication, its wide-ranging content
contains articles, news, reviews of records and live performances. Our
contributors include jazz authors, journalists, critics and musicians as well
as other Ellington enthusiasts.

You can read a sample article here:
[*"Jazz, Revue and a Thriller" The Response of the Birmingham Press to Duke
Ellingtonâ€™s 1933 Tour*]({{<static "/Blue Light 27-3 Sample Article.pdf">}})
, by Pedro Cravinho, Birmingham City University (PDF, 7.3MB).

## Join us

By joining us you'll receive our quarterly magazine and support the society's
activities. **New and returning paid members for 2021 will receive a free CD
with their subscription**.

## DESUK Live Broadcast: Uptown Lockdown

We're doing **live broadcasts** on Wednesday afternoons, 17:00 London time.
We will be discussing matters Ellington and Strayhorn, playing tracks as well
as a bit of live versions of their music. You can catch up at any time later.

More details on how to view and participate are on the [Uptown
Lockdown]({{<relref uptown_lockdown>}}) page.

## Forthcoming AGM

It was not possible to hold an AGM in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We
are hoping to hold one in the second half of 2021 and will keep our members
informed via Blue Light and this website. For the time being, the committee
from the 2019 AGM remains in place.
