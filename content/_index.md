# Welcome to DESUK

The Duke Ellington Society UK's purpose is to further the study, appreciation
and dissemination of the music of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington. It is
based in the United Kingdom, but membership is open to everyone.

In ordinary times we meet regularly in London to listen and socialise,
new arrivals always welcome. During the Covid-19 pandemic we've had to
suspend these meetings, but the society's social aspect continues under the
auspices of Uptown Lockdown (see below).

## Our Magazine: Blue Light

Our house publication [Blue Light]({{<relref blue_light>}}) is released
to members quarterly. A substantial publication, its wide-ranging content
contains articles, news, reviews of records and live performances. Our
contributors include jazz authors, journalists, critics and musicians as well
as other Ellington enthusiasts.

You can read a sample article here: [here](/Blue Light 27-3 Sample
Article.pdf) (PDF, 7.3MB).

## Join us

By joining us you'll receive our quarterly magazine and support the society's
activities. **New and returning paid members for 2021 will receive a free CD
with their subscription** (this is not available to overseas digital members).

## DESUK Live Broadcast: Uptown Lockdown

We're doing **live broadcasts** on Wednesday afternoons, 17:00 London time. We will be discussing matters Ellington and Strayhorn, playing tracks as well as a bit of live versions of their music. You can catch up at any time later.

More details on how to view and participate are on the [Uptown Lockdown]({{<relref uptown_lockdown>}}) page.

## 2020 AGM

The DESUK Annual General Meeting had been scheduled for Saturday, 2 May 2020. In view of the current health uncertainty  this meeting will not take place, nor can we give any indication of an alternative time.

As selection of a new Committee would normally have taken place at the AGM, all current committee members have indicated their willingness to continue in office until such time as normal business can be resumed, In this way we anticipate that DESUK features such as Blue Light can appear in the normal manner.

Please refer to the DESUK website for current information.
