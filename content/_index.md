# Welcome to DESUK

The Duke Ellington Society UK's purpose is to further the study, appreciation and dissemination of the music of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington.

We meet regularly in London to listen and socialise, and new arrivals are always welcome.

Our house publication [Blue Light]({{<relref blue_light>}}) is released quarterly. The content is wide ranging and we are fortunate to have amongst our members jazz authors, journalists and critics, and equally fortunate to have many enthusiastic members who, because of their own deep interest, have become expert in particular niches of Ellingtonia.

# AGM 2023 - Postponed!

Due to recently announced rail strikes, we will be postponing our AGM, which had
been due to take place on Saturday the 13th of May, at the Model Railway Club in
London. We’re very sorry for the disruption and look forward to booking a later
date. Please come see us! You also don’t have to wait till the AGM if you want
to get involved - drop us an email!

### Pigfoot Play Ellington

Pigfoot ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Pigfoot4), [Bandcamp](https://chrisbatchelor.bandcamp.com/releases)) presents an imaginative reworking of a range of Duke Ellington’s iconic compositions, from the early Cotton Club blues material to Swing hits and through to the exotica that was inspired by Ellington’s extensive travels.

> Pigfoot was formed by Chris Batchelor in 2013 to play classic 1920’s New Orleans material, spontaneously re-invented through the band’s wild musicality and wry humour. Their inquisitive exploration of repertoire then led them further afield, through a series of gigs entitled Pigfoot Play… Here they extended in all directions, with sets dedicated to Opera, Motown, Elvis, Bacharach and the hits of 1972.
>
> The members of Pigfoot are all devotees of the Ellington sound - the muted
> rasp of trumpeter Cootie Williams, the poised grace of Harry Carney’s
> baritone, the dense crunch of Duke’s piano voicings and the buoyant bounce of
> drummer Sonny Greer are all reflected in the engaging and individual
> approaches of Chris Batchelor, James Allsopp, Liam Noble and Paul Clarvis. An
> entertainingly riotous, swinging, delicate and atmospheric account of
> Ellington’s legacy is promised.

Lineup:

* Chris Batchelor - trumpet, Eb cornet
* James Allsopp - baritone sax, bass clarinet
* Liam Noble - piano
* Paul Clarvis - drums

Upcoming dates:

* November 7th 2023: JazzHastings.  East Hastings Sea Angling Association / The Stade / Hastings East Sussex / TN34 3FJ http://jazzhastings.co.uk
* November 14th 2023: Green Note Camden.  106 Parkway / Camden / London  / NW1 7AN Admission £15: Music 8.30 https://efglondonjazzfestival.org.uk
