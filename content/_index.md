# Welcome to DESUK

The Duke Ellington Society UK's purpose is to further the study, appreciation and dissemination of the music of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington.

We meet regularly in London to listen and socialise, and new arrivals are always welcome.

Our house publication **Blue Light** is released quarterly. The content is wide ranging and we are fortunate to have amongst our members jazz authors, journalists and critics, and equally fortunate to have many enthusiastic members who, because of their own deep interest, have become expert in particular niches of Ellingtonia.

## Next meeting

Saturday 10th August 2019, Civil Service Club ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/Rnxri95RcCLaJNAh6)) at 2pm. Come along, chat and hear music that is _beyond category_. The Civil Service Club has a bar and serves food. Facebook event page [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/423939041520047/ "Facebook event").
