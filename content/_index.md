# Welcome to DESUK

The Duke Ellington Society UK's purpose is to further the study, appreciation and dissemination of the music of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington.

We meet regularly in London to listen and socialise, and new arrivals are always welcome.

Our house publication [Blue Light]({{<relref blue_light>}}) is released quarterly. The content is wide ranging and we are fortunate to have amongst our members jazz authors, journalists and critics, and equally fortunate to have many enthusiastic members who, because of their own deep interest, have become expert in particular niches of Ellingtonia.

## 2021 AGM

A reminder that our AGM is taking place on the 16th of October, at the great
new location of the Model Railway Club. This is a wonderful opportunity for
members and fans of Duke Ellington to get involved in the Society and its work,
particularly if you’d like to help out with Blue Light or with the running of
the Society. The last AGM brought several new additions to the Committee and
we're looking forward to new faces this time too.

The AGM will start at 1pm, though we have the room booked from noon if you are
a little early. A bar with snacks, hot drinks, soft drinks and alcohol will be
in operation. Please note the room is up one flight of stairs and there is
unfortunately no lift.

After the formal proceedings there will be musical entertainment - we are proud
to present The Frank Griffith Trio with Dave Green and Colin Oxley!

The full address is: Model Railway Club, Keen House, 4 Calshot St, London N1
9DA. Google Maps location [here](https://goo.gl/maps/Fg8qafdsvPTxgA5j8).
