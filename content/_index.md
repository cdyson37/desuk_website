# Welcome to DESUK

The Duke Ellington Society UK's purpose is to further the study, appreciation and dissemination of the music of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington.

We meet regularly in London to listen and socialise, and new arrivals are always welcome.

Our house publication [Blue Light]({{<relref blue_light>}}) is released quarterly. The content is wide ranging and we are fortunate to have amongst our members jazz authors, journalists and critics, and equally fortunate to have many enthusiastic members who, because of their own deep interest, have become expert in particular niches of Ellingtonia.

## DESUK Live Broadcast: Uptown Lockdown

**UPDATE** [Uptown Lockdown]({{<relref uptown_lockdown>}}) is temporarily suspended due to its host and producer being indisposed - it will not be broadcast on Wednesday 14th October 2020. On the plus side, now is a great time to catch up on any episodes you missed [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq3QqJgdSJwk4nlmnnaH42Q/).

## Chat to us

We're chatting online using Discord - join us at https://discord.gg/efQNUMa.

## 2020 AGM

The DESUK Annual General Meeting had been scheduled for Saturday, 2 May 2020. In view of the current health uncertainty  this meeting will not take place, nor can we give any indication of an alternative time.

As selection of a new Committee would normally have taken place at the AGM, all current committee members have indicated their willingness to continue in office until such time as normal business can be resumed, In this way we anticipate that DESUK features such as Blue Light can appear in the normal manner.

Please refer to the DESUK website for current information.
