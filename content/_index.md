# Welcome to DESUK

The Duke Ellington Society UK's purpose is to further the study, appreciation
and dissemination of the music of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington. It is
based in the United Kingdom, but membership is open to everyone.

In ordinary times we meet regularly in London to listen and socialise, and
new arrivals always welcome. During the Covid-19 pandemic we've had to
suspend these meetings, but the society's social aspect continues under the
auspices of Uptown Lockdown (see below).

## AGM Update: Planned October 2021 Meeting

You will recall that because of the coming of Covid-19 and the first lockdown
we had to postpone last year’s Annual General Meeting. In the end, with the
worsening situation at the end of 2020 and the imposition of the new
lockdown, we had to abandon the idea of a 2020 AGM altogether.

We have now agreed provisionally to hold an AGM on Saturday 16 October 2021,
at 1pm. The location is the *Model Railway Club, Keen House, 4 Calshot Street,
London N1 9DA*.

Calshot Street is situated just off Pentonville Road (left side), under 10
minutes' walk from Kings Cross and St Pancras stations. There are bus stops
nearby. See [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/Dw59Ksv1chEaY5Nm6).

In the continuing uncertainty regarding the pandemic this has to be a
provisional arrangement, but the date and venue are booked.

You will receive updates and further details during the year in successive
issues of *Blue Light*, and these will also be posted on the DESUK Website.

So that we can better update you, please make sure we have an up-to-date email
address for you. You can get in touch with us at {{<desuk_email>}}.
