# Welcome to DESUK

The Duke Ellington Society UK's purpose is to further the study, appreciation and dissemination of the music of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington.

We meet regularly in London to listen and socialise, and new arrivals are always welcome.

Our house publication [Blue Light]({{<relref blue_light>}}) is released quarterly. The content is wide ranging and we are fortunate to have amongst our members jazz authors, journalists and critics, and equally fortunate to have many enthusiastic members who, because of their own deep interest, have become expert in particular niches of Ellingtonia.

# AGM 2023 - We need a Treasurer!

We will be holding our Annual General Meeting on Saturday the 13th of May 2023, in London. Full details to follow. We urgently need a new Treasurer to keep the society running. If you feel you could help in this or another capacity, please get in touch or turn up on the day. You will be warmly welcomed!

# Urgent: New Treasurer Required

An important notice from our Chairman:

> Due to the onset of ill-health, our Treasurer - Grant Elliot - has been
obliged to advise that he will no longer be able to continue his duties in
future.
>
> An insert in the last issue of Blue Light requesting volunteer(s) for the role
produced no results.
>
> So again I am writing, to  all members, to request any suitably experienced
person(s) to urgently consider taking on this important position.
>
> If you would like an outline of the duties involved please <a
href="mailto:desuk@dukeellington.org.uk">contact us</a>.
>
> Once again i would emphasise the urgency and importance of this call for
assistance. Quite frankly, and with great sadness, I need to suggest that if we
are unable to appoint a suitable person, then in all probability DESUK will be
unable to operate in future.

### Pigfoot Play Ellington

Pigfoot ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Pigfoot4), [Bandcamp](https://chrisbatchelor.bandcamp.com/releases)) presents an imaginative reworking of a range of Duke Ellington’s iconic compositions, from the early Cotton Club blues material to Swing hits and through to the exotica that was inspired by Ellington’s extensive travels.

> Pigfoot was formed by Chris Batchelor in 2013 to play classic 1920’s New Orleans material, spontaneously re-invented through the band’s wild musicality and wry humour. Their inquisitive exploration of repertoire then led them further afield, through a series of gigs entitled Pigfoot Play… Here they extended in all directions, with sets dedicated to Opera, Motown, Elvis, Bacharach and the hits of 1972.
>
> The members of Pigfoot are all devotees of the Ellington sound - the muted
> rasp of trumpeter Cootie Williams, the poised grace of Harry Carney’s
> baritone, the dense crunch of Duke’s piano voicings and the buoyant bounce of
> drummer Sonny Greer are all reflected in the engaging and individual
> approaches of Chris Batchelor, James Allsopp, Liam Noble and Paul Clarvis. An
> entertainingly riotous, swinging, delicate and atmospheric account of
> Ellington’s legacy is promised.

* Chris Batchelor - trumpet, Eb cornet
