# Welcome to DESUK

The Duke Ellington Society UK's purpose is to further the study, appreciation and dissemination of the music of Edward Kennedy 'Duke' Ellington.

We meet regularly in London to listen and socialise, and new arrivals are always welcome.

Our house publication [Blue Light]({{<relref blue_light>}}) is released quarterly. The content is wide ranging and we are fortunate to have amongst our members jazz authors, journalists and critics, and equally fortunate to have many enthusiastic members who, because of their own deep interest, have become expert in particular niches of Ellingtonia.

## Next meeting

... will be in 2020! Happy New Year from us and watch this space.

## 2020 AGM

Save the date: Saturday 2nd May 2020, London. Details to follow.

## Non-society events

Got a gig coming up with an Ellington element? <a href="mailto:desuk@dukeellington.org.uk">Pop us an email</a> and we can publicise via our website.

### Harmony In Harlem - Cambridge

> Harmony In Harlem return to St Andrew's Street Baptiest Church in Cambridge for what is becoming an annual fixture. On Saturday 29th February 2020 our theme is Primping for the Prom from one of our new titles, but the centrepiece of the show is the challenging, rip-roaring *Diminuendo in Blue & Crescendo in Blue*. We will also feature *The Mooche*, *Clarinet Melodrama* and Billy Strayhorn's harrowing *Blood Count.*

More details and tickets [here](http://www.harmonyinharlem.co.uk).

### Mike Westbrook's Uncommon Orchestra: On Duke's Birthday

Ronnie Scott's, London will host Mike Westbrook's Uncommon Orchestra on Duke Ellington's birthday, Wednesday 29th April 2020, with a piece dedicated to the Ducal anniversary.

> This will be the first time that the full-scale version of the piece will have been performed in London. The fact that April 29th is Ellington’s birthday makes this an even more special occasion.
