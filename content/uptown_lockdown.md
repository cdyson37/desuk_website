Uptown Lockdown is our regular live video and audio broadcast of Ellingtonia-related music and interviews. New episodes are currently being produced monthly and are available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq3QqJgdSJwk4nlmnnaH42Q/).

We also have a public _Discord_ chatroom which might be useful in the event of any difficulties, or if you just fancy some Ducal chat: https://discord.gg/efQNUMa
