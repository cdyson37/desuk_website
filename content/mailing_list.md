DESUK runs an email list to keep members and non-members informed about upcoming issues of Blue Light, society events, membership renewal deadlines, online materials and other news from the wider world of Ellingtonia. The emails are irregular and we promise not to bombard subscribers with spam. You can unsubscribe at any time.
