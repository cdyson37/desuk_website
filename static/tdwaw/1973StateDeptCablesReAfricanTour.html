<p> In late 1973 Ellington and his orchestra made Duke's last European 
concert tour, but the State Department arranged for them to go to Africa
 as well.  <br><br>These U.S. State Department cables about the African leg of the tour are from <a href="https://wikileaks.org/" target="_blank">Wikileaks</a>, which I am uncomfortable visiting.<br><br><br></p>

 WHILE EMBASSY NORMALLY WOULD WELCOME VISIT TO KENYA BY DUKE ELLINGTON 
ORCHESTRA, WE FAIL TO SEE HOW NOVEMBER VISIT BY THIS ORCHESTRA WOULD BE 
RESPONSIVE TO SPECIFIC GOK REQUEST FOR USG TO SUPPLY JACKSON FIVE TO 
PLAY AT INDEPENDENCE ANNIVERSARY FUNCTIONS PLANNED FOR DECEMBER 12 AND 
DAYS  IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THAT DATE. IN FACT, IF DUKE ELLINGTON
 ORCHESTRA WERE TO COME TO KENYA NOVEMBER 23-24 AS PROPOSED REF B, WE 
WOULD STRONGLY OPPOSE BILLING IT "AS USG GESTURE HONORING KENYAN 
INDEPENDENCE" AS SUGGESTED REF C. TO DO SO COULD BE HIGHLY OFFENSIVE TO 
THOSE IN GOK RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING INDEPENDENCE CELEBRATIONS AND 
COULD GIVERISE TO FEELING THAT US -- UNLIKE OTHER MORE COOPERATIVE 
COUNTRIES -- PREFERS TO "GO IT ALONE" IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE PUBLIC 
RELATIONS IMPACT.<br><br>2. EMBASSY AND USIS, THEREFORE, RECOMMEND THAT 
DEPARTMENT CONSIDER WAYS OF RESPONDING POSITIVELY TO GOK REQUEST. OUR 
PREFERENCES WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS: (1) JACKSON FIVE OR (2) SIMILAR ROCK 
GROUP WHICH WOULD BE ABLE TO COME TO KENYA ON DATES REQUESTED.<br><br>LIMITED OFFICIAL USE<br>LIMITED OFFICIAL USE<br>PAGE 02  NAIROB 04497  110756Z<br><br>3.
 WHILE WE APPRECIATE FUNDING PROBLEM CREATED BY COMMITMENT TO DUKE 
ELLINGTON (ON WHICH WE WERE NOT CONSULTED), WE WOULD STRONGLY URGE 
DEPARTMENT TO SEEK FUNDING TO SUPPORT TYPE PARTICIPATION REQUESTED BY 
GOK FROM OTHER SOURCES OR, IF NECESSARY AND CONTRACTUALLY FEASIBLE, BY 
ELIMINATING KENYA PORTION OF ELLINGTON VISIT. WE ARE, THEREFORE, 
DEFERRING ACCEPTANCE ELLINGTON VISIT PROPOSED REF B.<br><br>4. FURTHER 
INDICATION OF EXTENT TO WHICH GOK COUNTING ON OUR PARTICIPATION WAS 
GIVEN YESTERDAY WHEN CHIEF OF PROTOCOL GACHUKIA SOUGHT OUT CHARGE' AT 
SOCIAL FUNCTION TO STATE GOK PLANNING COMMITTEE'S CONCERN OVER OUR LACK 
OF RESPONSE TO DATE ON JACKSON FIVE REQUEST. HE SAID THEY ARE COUNTING 
HEAVILY ON IT AND THAT KENYAN YOUTH WOULD BE PARTICULARLY DISAPPOINTED.

HE WOULD ADVISE GACHUKIA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. LINDSTROM<br><br>LIMITED OFFICIAL USE<br>NNN<br><br><br></li>
