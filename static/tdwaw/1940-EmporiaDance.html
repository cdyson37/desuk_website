<div class="intro">
<p>On Thursday, May 9, 1940, <strong>Duke Ellington and His Famous Orchestra</strong>
 arrived in Emporia, Kansas to play for the Grand Ball celebrating the 
opening of the new Civic Auditorium during the city's first annual <strong><a title="The name Fiestaval was created by combining Fiesta with Carnaval.">Fiestaval</a></strong> festival.

<br><br>The ads for Emporia's First Annual Fiestaval May 5 to 10 
included exhortations to plan to attend the grand opening of the new 
$600,000 Civic Auditorium.

<br><br> Fiestaval began Sunday, May 5, with a community-wide religious 
service.  On Monday a dedication program was attended by 2,500, and 
speeches were made by the governors of Kansas and Missouri.  The civic 
parade on May 7, with about 170 parade units, was seen by an estimated 
10,000 people. It was followed by an historic pageant and a square 
dance. <br><br>On Wednesday, a vaudeville show called "Three Cheers" was
 performed at 3:30, 7:30 and 10:00.  It featured "name" Nick Lucas, Sid 
Page and Peggy, the Broadway Darlings dancers and Bobby Pope, His Blues 
Trumpet and Orchestra, and included the comedy teams of Hill and Hill 
and The Arkansas Hotshots, a novelty dance team Dennet and Dae, and 
dancer Donny Dee, acrobats the "Mad MacBrides," and the Ziemba Troupe.

<br><br>The Fiestaval Grand Ball came Thursday evening, May 9, with 
Ellington providing the music.  The Queen of the festival and her party 
entered to The Triumphal March from Aida, played by Ellington and his 
orchestra.  Since the band did not have this in its repertoire, 
Ellington was given the sheet music and wrote a band arrangement shortly
 before the dance.<br><br>Since a dance for African-Americans (without Ellington) was held May 10, it would seem the May 9 dance was for whites only.</p>


<hr><p>The <strong>Emporia Gazette</strong> provided an extraordinary level of coverage. <a href="#clippings">Click here</a> to see the ads, advance publicity and other reviews published in the Gazette during April and May.  <br><br>I was particularly taken by this 1,800 word review <i>cum</i> essay, written by the owner of the newspaper, <strong>William A. White</strong>, published May 10 in his newspaper.  Parts of his review were copied by other newspapers in the region.</p>

William A. White:<p class="bq" width="80%">&nbsp; 'Last night, for three
 hours and a half, 2,000 Emporians on a gorgeous dance floor in the 
Civic auditorium - so thick you could stir them with a  spoon - busted 
bustles to music furnished by Duke Ellington, the colored swinging, 
jittering, jiving dance band leader.  Two thousand other citizens of 
Emporia and vicinity looked on from well-filled galleries at the amazing
 spectacle.<br><br>&nbsp; And amazing it was - a cornucopia of flashing 
color.  Its movement was up and down rather than sideways and while the 
crowd flowed gently around the great hall, from right to left, the 
vertical movement was jerky and gave the impression that the dancers 
were fighting a hive of Bolshevik bees!  However it was a gaudy gala and
 beautiful crowd - and cold sober!  Many of the men - perhaps one out of
 six - were in white evening coats with black ties, and most of the 
women had on something that was or looked like ball dresses.  And now 
about the music:<br>
</p><p class="bqc"><br>****<br></p>
<p class="bq">&nbsp; (But before we go into that, as the lawyers say, 
let us qualify as an expert.  Fifty-five years ago and more, the writer 
hereof earned his first dollar playing for dances in Butler county, a 
young boy in his middle teens.  We make no boasts but our outfit 
consisting of a blind fidler, a competent cornetist and deponent at the 
cabinet organ or piano, as the case happened to be - used to go out in 
the country to farm dances, where they took down the bed and the 
cookstove and emptied the houses and danced in three rooms.  Mostly we 
played square dances, thought we had two or three waltzes - "The First 
Kiss Waltz," "The Cornflower Waltz," the "Skaters" and "Where, Oh Where 
Has My Little Dog Gone?"  There wasn't a note in the lot.  We all played
 by ear.  As for calling off the square dances - the blind fiddler 
couldn't see to do it, the cornetist was busy with something else, so it
 fell upon this affiant to play the cabinet organ and call off - by 
which task we had to let out a boy's changing voice so that, after a 
year of it, we could be heard on a clear, windless, moonlit night in 
three townships, and we made a hog-caller look like a Quaker meeting.  
We were, in a way, the Duke Ellington of the Walnut valley.  So, looking
 back over nearly 60 years, we can persuade the gentle reader that we 
know something about dance music as the light fantastic - or more or 
less fantastic - Kansas toe was tripped in the middle or early 1880's.<br>
</p><p class="bqc"><br>****<br></p>
<p class="bq">&nbsp; And how music and the dance have changed in these 
two passing generations!  The change marks better than anything else the
 spirit of the times.  A few years after our Butler county experience, 
we used to dance here in Emporia at the skating rink on the corner of 
Eighth and Commercial; in Bancroft's hall, a barny room on the third 
floor at the corner of Fifth and Commercial, and a few years later, in 
the Wigwam on Merchant Street. In those pre-historic days, dance music 
was tuneful, something you could whistle, and as we know full well by 
pleasant experience, something that could be harmonized in simple chords
 and when one knew the key the tune was cast in, an accompaniment could 
be faked in that key by six or seven simple major and minor chords. But 
the ancient music had consistent flowing cadence, definite harmony and 
distinct rhythm that was carried by the melody, by the flow of the tune.
  The rhythm was not syncopated and sometimes the tunes were so well 
known, being popular songs, that the dancers would break into song as 
the danced - as for instance, in a square dance to one of Stephen 
Foster's songs, the dancers would catch and carry the tune carrolling:<br><br>"Gwine to ride all night.<br>"Gwine to ride all day;<br>"Bet my money on a bob-tailed nag.<br>"Who's going to bet on de bay?"<br><br>&nbsp; Or maybe a more ancient tune of the Fifties:<br><br>"Car'line, Car'llin<br>"Can't you dance a peavine?<br>"Ol' Ann Jemima,<br>"Ho, hi, ho!"<br><br>Or even in the slow waltzes the party would sing:<br><br>"Sweet dreamland faces<br>"Fussing to and fro:<br>"Bringing fond memories<br>"Of the long ago."<br><br>&nbsp; and another favorite which the dancers sometimes sang as they waltzed with rather formal step and slow:<br><br>"Love comes like a summer sigh<br>"Softly o'er us stealing!<br>"Love comes and we wonder why<br>"At love's shrine we're kneeling."<br><br>&nbsp;
 And with a buxom armful of gently protesting but finally surrendering, 
cornfed, Walnut valley gal in your arms, to the slow and formal threnody
 of the waltz, a fellow kind of felt he was of some importance and had a
 lot of authority in a busy and aspiring world. The tunes tangled in 
one's dreams for days; and the pressure of a warm hand - and even if it 
was a little sweaty and sticky it was young and ardent - might linger 
through life.  Indeed that saccharine waltz tune might beat finally in a
 dusty heart that "had lain for a century dead!"</p>

<p class="bqc"><br>****<br></p>

<p class="bq">&nbsp; Now these details of the dance romantic which your 
fathers ang grandfathers knew in the seventies and eighties - you young 
bloods of the fifth decade of this century - were as different from the 
dance we saw last night and the music was as different from that which 
squawked and shrieked and roared and bellowed in syncopated savagery as 
if the two - the music and the dance of th eold days - had been threaded
 and heard upon another planet.  Moreover - and here we take a long deep
 breath before saying if that noise last night in the Civic auditorium 
for which the town paid $1,100 to Mr. Duke Ellington, is music, then the
 subscriber hereto is a trapeze performaer.  The point is, if you wish 
to knwo, that dance music today is merely syncopated, blood raw emotion,
 without harmony, without consistent rhtythm, and with no more tune that
 the yearnful bellowing of a lonely yearning and romantic cow in the 
pastures or the raucous staccatto meditation of a bulldog barking in a 
barrel.  "Shoot if you must this old bald head" but you might just as 
well know the God's truth about it.</p>

<p class="bqc"><br>****<br></p>

<p class="bq">&nbsp; Looking from the second balcony for two hours at 
the dancing crowd last night, the first dancing crowd I have watched for
 many a long year, I was tremendously impressed with the fact that there
 were no new steps there; also amused to observe that the same music 
last night incited different couples to different kinds of dancing.  But
 evrey step that any couple danced last night was almost the exact 
reproduction of some gay galloping that must have originated many 
thousand years ago.  That same step was preserved in the old square 
dances in the little prairie shacks in the Walnut valley 60 years ago.  
The thing we used to call a "hoedown" which we indulged in when the 
caller-off said "Everybody dance," was nothing more than the jitterbug. 
 And the scraping, sideways bustle flopping hip-hinging (sic) form used 
by many other dancers last night was very much like do-si-dos in the 
square dance.  And the hop-skip-and-jump, tumble-in-the-hay that some 
dancers used last night was only the "grand sashay" that I used to 
bellow when I got the dancers a bit tangled up in the 'eighties and 
could not straighten them out.  The "peavine" that was challenged in the
 old song to Ann Jemimah  above mentioned was the jitterbug preserved in
 the amber of time.  But it was the same old showoff that mating animals
 have used far down the zoological line through the beasts of the 
fields, the birds of the air and the lightning bugs on a summer evening.
  At bottom it is deep calling unto the deep unto the deep to keep the 
life stream flowing!  How could it all be less than beautiful - this 
vast primeval panorama that flowed so slowly around the big hall with 
its kaleidosope of ever mingling colors and forms.</p>

<p class="bqc"><br>****<br></p>

<p class="bq">&nbsp; Kipling asks the old question:  "It is beautiful 
but is it art?"  Probably all art is emotion.  I believe that the finest
 art comes out of constructive rather than destructive emotion.  And to 
keep the world moving, fecund, is the finest and loveliest art of all.  
In a time when destructive emotion, hate and jealousy and terror are 
bringing death and devastation to the earth, it is good to see youth 
carefree and intent upon the main business of youth - joyously building 
up its own art, conforming to its own day and generation.  For how could
 the slow, moving, billowy, syrupy muisc of the 'eighties fit into this 
new world picture?  Youth had to construct its rowdy modern music.  
Youth today had to revive the primal passions that moved the old dances 
if youth felt at all in terms of its own contemporary life.  So let Duke
 Ellington and his black boys blare and bleat and bawl with their 
saxophones and bull fiddles and muted trumpets syncopating the call of 
the wild.  And it is all right.  But it's the same old inner urge, the 
more we change the less we change.</p>

<p class="bqc"><br>****<br></p>

<p class="bq">&nbsp; One of the really interesting sights on last 
night's dance floor was the crowd of adorers who stood like acolytes, 
crowding in front of the stage, motionless, a hundred of them, watching 
with eager worshipping faces every movement of Duke Ellington and his 
band.  There were country band leaders from all over Kansas: from as far
 west as Burrton, as far east as Lawrence, as far south as Sedan and 
north as Manhattan.  They stood there all evening with their eyes glued 
on the band.  Never a toe did they wiggle and never a foot did they 
jostle, all popeyed, listening, watching, trying to find out how to get 
in the big money.  Their passionate curiosity was as real as the 
electric urges that were throbbing through the moving crowd.  The 
oldsters who watched it, the dancers and the alter acolytes were 
something pretty real in it all.  Life and youth, the modern world, 
dancing on the brink of the abysm that is tomorrow!  It was a brave and 
cheering spectacle, and also most beautiful.  And through it all across 
two genearations we heard the dying notes of a young voice bawling: 
"Swing your partners, same on the corner balance all and a grand right 
and left" and the wild echoes flying in "Shake your wooden leg Sal my 
gal, show them fellers your balmoral!"<br><span style="float:right;clear:right;">-W.A.W.</span>'</p>
