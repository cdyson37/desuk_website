Duke Ellington and his orchestra played a small tour of the Caribbean in June 1969.  The local paper in Jamaica, The Gleaner (Daily and Sunday editions), provided an extraordinary level of coverage which is summarized here.
<br><br>Plans seemed to have changed while Duke and his orchestra were on the island.  The coverage jumps around in time, but the events are in chronological order
in the <a href=http://tdwaw.ca target=_blank>The Duke - Where and When</a>.</p>
