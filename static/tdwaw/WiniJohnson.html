<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size:1.45em; font-style: italic;">




Wini Johnson</span> was a dancer, vocalist and entertainer who joined Ellington's orchestra in Detroit in February 1944. She left the orchestra in late September or in early October 1944 when it played the Downtown Theatre in Chicago.  While Ellington advertisements with her name appeared until mid-October, this was likely because advertising copy would have used information sent to the venue managers some weeks before the events.<br><br>Wini married Dr. Middleton H. ("Midi" or "Middie") Lambright Jr. in 1945 and they made their home in Cleveland, where they seem to have been socially prominent. <br><br>Wini Johnson Lambright appeared on the cover of Jet Magazine in 1952 and was mentioned in that magazine from time to time in the 1950s and early 1960s.  The Lambrights were divorced, and Wini remarried a George Lee, but was separated from him in or by 1969.  She died in 1980.</p>

<p>Ellington or his ghost writer Stanley Dance wrote about this vocalist as Wini Brown in <i>Music is My Mistress</i>:</p>
<div style="margin: 0 16%; border:1px dashed; padding:10px;">

<h4 style=text-align:center; margin:0;>Wini Brown</h4>
Wini Brown's father was one of the intellectual waiters who graduated from the old Cotton Club.  He was intelligent and hip, as all of the Cotton Club waiters were in those days.  He had two lovely daughters and two handsome sons, and they lived across the street from us on St. Nicholas Avenue.  When Wini became a chorus girl at the Cotton Club, she was so young she had to have her mother bring her to work and come back at the end of the show to take her home.  Wini first married Stepin Fetchit and then, in 1944, when we were playing in the Hurricane, she was in a Broadway show called <i>Early to Bed</i>.  One night the entire cast came to the Hurricane for one of their celebrations, and Wini, always a put-on artist, took her turn singing.  She got such a good audience reaction that, when I went over to congratulate her and gave her good wishes, I invited her to join the band.  She was a beautiful chick and she copped out by saying, "You've got to be kidding!  I'm not a singer, I'm a dancer."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, she opened with us our first night out of town at the Downtown Theatre on State Street in Chicago.  Dusty Fletcher was on the bill too, I remember.  Everything was going fine until a very famous young doctor, Midi Lambright, married her and dragged her off to Cleveland.

</div>

<p>Despite its title and several factual errors, the <i>MIMM</i> article is clearly about <b>Wini Johnson</b>.  <b>Wini Brown</b>, about ten years younger than Wini Johnson, graduated from Englehart High School in Chicago, singing first with Eddie Mallory's orchestra under the name Annabella, then joining Lionel Hampton's band at age 18 in February 1946 as Winnie or Wini Brown, shortly after Wini Johnson left the scene.  Wini Johnson Lambright appears to have lived with her son and her second husband in Cleveland during Ms Brown's career.</p>

<p>The Fats Waller Broadway musical "Early to Bed" played at the Broadhurst Theater from June 1943 to May 1944. Wini's visit to the Hurricane was probably during the spring or summer of 1943 since Ellington was there from April to September that year.  By the time his orchestra returned to the restaurant at the end of March 1944, Wini was already with the band.</p>

<p>MIMM's misidentification of the singer caused some confusion in the world of Ellington research. The confusion was made worse because Wini Brown worked and recorded with then-former Ellingtonian Cootie Williams during the 1950s.</p>

<p>Former Ellington publicist and noted Ellington authority Patricia Willard believes the MIMM misnaming was Dance's mistake. She says Stanley tended to guess, improvise and contradict, and points out a number of errors in MIMM she attributes do him. She suggests</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; padding-left:3px; border-left: dashed 1px;">'With the Winis, he obviously chose to assume this was one person because of the unconventional spelling of the given name so he chose his favorite surname to go with it...'</blockquote>

<p> Ms Willard says Duke told her Dance "changed and omitted a lot of what I wrote without consulting me."  Writer/producer Helen Oakley Dance, Stanley's wife, told her Doubleday's final contract for the manuscript was with Stanley since Duke had missed his agreed-upon deadline, procrastinating while spending his advance.  Duke told Mrs. Willard he was not offered final approval of Stanley's completed manuscript because Doubleday was eager to get the book out. </p>

<p>In any event, the following research will demonstrate the lady named Wini Brown in MIMM was Wini Johnson.</p>

<h2 align=center style="border:3px solid red;">Who was Wini Johnson?</h2>
<p>From her brother's autobiography (<a href=https://books.google.ca/books?id=pWfwAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT13&lpg=PT13&dq=stretch+johnson&source=bl&ots=sd7B6RZc30&sig=ahMW6L5895zKhcURcSIdZkB5NAA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjt2ZHS35XUAhWK0FQKHbl2Bj4Q6AEInwEwGA target=_blank>Howard Eugene Johnson: A Dancer in the Revolution: Stretch Johnson, Harlem Communist at the Cotton Club
By Howard Eugene Johnson</a>) and obituary we learn:</p<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Winifred Claudia (Wini or Winnie) Johnson</b> was born 1917-12-03 and named  in honour of an aunt's boyfriend, Claude Winfrey.  She came from a family of high achievers.</li>

<li>Her father was <b>"Monk" Johnson</b>, a baseball player for the McConnell Giants, Grand Central Red Caps and Lincoln Giants, a basketball player for the St. Christopher's, the Independents and the Puritans, who was a pool hustler, card shark, crapshooter, Cotton Club waiter, and ex-convict (he and Cotton Club owner <b>Owney Madden</b> were prisoners in Sing Sing at the same time.</li>

<li>Wini's mother's name was <b>Gertrude McGinnis</b>, nee <b>DeGroat</b></li>

<li>Wini's siblings were:
    <ul><li><b>Howard Eugene ("Stretch") Johnson</b>, born in Orange, N.J. 1915-01-30. Howard, the eldest, became a Cotton Club dancer after Wini, and was an activist and a member of the Communist Party until 1956.  Passing his high school equivalency test in 1959, he enrolled in Columbia College in 1960. In 1968, he became director of the "Upward Bound Program" to help disadvantaged youth from New York enter college, and he became a professor of sociology, teaching black studies, at SUNY's New Paltz campus.</li>
    <li><b>Robert Quentin (Bobby) Johnson</b> born 1921-01-27</li>
    <li><b>Wesley Williams Johnson</b>, born 1923-03-26</li>
    <li><b>Shirley Gertrude Johnson</b> (d.o.b.?)</li></ul>
</li>

<li>The family moved to New York in 1932 (source: <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/12/nyregion/stretch-johnson-85-tap-dancer-and-activist.html  target=_blank>New York Times obituary</a>)</li>

<li>Wini's paternal grandparents were <b>George Gaither</b> and <b>Lethia Goode</b> (aka <b>Lethia Johnson</b>).  The family name Johnson was taken to honour Eugene Johnson, who looked out for George's family while George was away at war.</li>

<li>Lethia's brother <b>James Anderson</b> founded <i>Amsterdam News</i>.</li>

<li>Stretch described his sister as "a Cotton Club dancer who later went on to sing with the Duke Ellington Orchestra."  He also wrote:<p class=bq>'My next connection with the Cotton Club came through my sister Winnie, who danced at local affairs sponsored by social clubs that wanted a floor show... Bill "Bojangles" Robinson had heard about Winnie's talent and offered her a week at the Alhambra Theater with him if she could do his routine.  Winnie learned the routine in no time&ndash;she had what might be called a photographic memory in her muscles and could reproduce steps within two or three tries if they were complicated; once was enough for the simpler combinations&ndash;and she got the week's work.  <b>Elida Webb</b>, choreograher and talent scout for the Cotton Club, heard about Winnie from Bill Robinson and hired her for the chorus of the revue "Flying Colors" from which she would go to the Cotton Club for more stable employment...<br><br>
My sister Winnie was one of the most beautiful of the beautiful array of feminine pulchritude.  As a group, they had their choice of the most eligible Black males on the planet... Some of the women had multiple lovers.  My sister Winnie numbered among her lovers, and sometimes husbands, Bill Robinson, Joe Louis, "Chuck" Green, Adam Clayton Powell, Canada Lee, Duke Ellington, and the penultimate husband before her last marriage to Dr. Middleton Lambright, the disastrous Stepin Fetchit...'</p></li>

<li>Howard and Wini's aunt Tina "went with" Willie "the Lion" Smith and James P. Johnson.</li>
</ul>
<h2 align=center style="border:3px solid red;">Wini Johnson's career before Ellington</h2>
<ul>

<li>Far from being unknown to Ellington when he hired her, Wini Johnson was well known in the entertainment world of New York in the 1930s and 1940s, with many mentions in the newspapers as  "Winnie Johnson."</li>

<li>Winnie Johnson (Mrs. Stepin Fetchit) and two other Cotton Club girls are pictured in the The Pittsburgh Courier, 1938-10-08  p.13 under the heading Work and Beauty Go hand in Hand.</li>

<li>The New York Sun, 1942-06-12  p.3 and the Pittsburgh Courier 1942-06-20 p.21 reported Stepin Fetchit was ordered by a court to pay Winnie Johnson $12 a week child support.  Rowe's column in the PC 1942-05-16 said the "case was tossed out of court and is being re-written for a later hearing."</li>

<li>Billy Rowe's Note Book, The Pittsburgh Courier, 1942-09-05, p.21 was giving up show business for higher education with a private tutor in Chicago.</li>

<li>The Pittsburgh Courier 1942-12-05 p.20 reported "Winnie Johnson, who has given up the stage for a lawyers's office, came to town for a breather last week and took her son Donald back to the Windy City to keep her company."</li>

<li>Billy Rowe's Note Book in The Pittsburgh Courier, 1943-02-27, p.20 said she had completed her studies in Chicago and "those shapely legs that used to parade up and down the Cotton Club floor are now pushed under a desk in a local rationing board office."</li>

<h2 align=center style="border:3px solid red;">Wini Johnson's career with Ellington</h2>

<li>These photos cover Winnie Johnson's months with the Ellington orchestra.  <a href=/images/Collage-WiniJohnsonWithDuke.png target=_blank>Click the collage to enlarge it.<img align=center src=./images/Collage-WiniJohnsonWithDuke.png style="float:right; width:400px; height:auto;" alt="Photo collage of Wini Johnson during her Ellington months"></a></li>

<li>Barry Ulanov's 1946 biography <i>Duke Ellington</i> p. 271, says Wini replaced Betty Roch&eacute; in 1943. She actually joined the Ellington orchestra in Detroit in mid-February, 1944.  She may have been hired in late January or early February since the Duke Ellington, Inc., March 31, 1944 financial statements show she borrowed $125 from DEI on February 4 and DEI paid her New York to Detroit train fare on February 15.</li>

<i>New Desor</i> Vol. 2, <i>Stratemann</i> p.256 and <i>Variety</i> 1944-02-16 p.37 report she joined the band on February 11.  Ted Yates' <i>I've Been Around</i> column in the Kansas City <i>Plaindealer</i> 1944-03-03 p.6 says "Wini Johnson now with Duke Ellington's Band."  These reports differ from England's <i>The Melody Maker and Rhythm</i> 1944-03-18, which reported she joined Ellington "this week."<br><br></li>

<li>There were no reviews of the Detroit opening day performances in <i>The Billboard</i>, <i>Variety</i> nor The Detroit Free Press, so Wini's presence prior to February 15 has not been confirmed. </li>

<li><i>The Pittsburgh Courier</i> 1944-02-19 p.15 reported Wini joined the band as an addition to, but not a replacement for, Betty Roch&eacute;<sup>22</sup></li>

<li>"Winnie Johnson" is named in The Detroit Free Press Paradise Theater ads Feb. 10, 11 and 13, but not in the ads on Feb. 12 or Feb. 14 to 17, which were a different and simpler design. (Betty Roche is named in all the ads from Feb. 10 to Feb. 16.)</li>

<li>The Palace theatre ads in the <i>Akron Beacon Journal</i> 1944-02-17 to 1944-02-19 include Winnie Johnson as a featured act.</li>

<li>The RKO Palace ad in <i>The Columbus Dispatch</i> 1944-02-29 p.B-5 names Wini Johnson.</li>

<li><i>The Pittsburgh Courier</i>, 1944-02-19 p.15 announced Winsome Wini Johnson had joined Duke Ellington's orchestra as featured vocalist in addition to Betty Roch&eacute;, who was staying with the orchestra (the same announcement said Herb Jeffries had rejoined the band).</li>

<li>A plug for Ellington's appearance at the Palace  in <i>The Columbus Dispatch</i>, 1944-02-24 p.10-A, includes "<i>as a special attraction, beauteous Wini Johnson, singing star of the Broadway stage hit, 'Early to Bed,' will be featured.</i>" Page 3_F of the 1944-02-27 edition includes her publicity portrait. Its caption describes her as a featured member of Ellington's show. Wini is listed in the ads from 1944-02-28 to 1944-03-01.  The review in the 1944-03-01 edition says "...Wini Johnson, like the majority of Ellington's vocalists, is easier to look at than listen to."</li>

<li>Winnie was named as a supporting act in the announcement, ad and review of Ellington's appearance at the RKO Temple in the <i>Rochester Times-Union</i>, 1944-03-01 p.10 and 1944-03-02 p.20, and in the <i>Rochester Daily Record</i>, 1944-03-04 p.2.  The ad includes her picture.</li>

<li>A charming portrait of a smiling Wini Johnson appears in <i>The Boston Herald</i>, 1944-03-12, p.41.  <i>Variety</i>'s 1944-03-15 review of the March 9 show at the RKO Boston says she sang "<i>People Will Say</i>" and "<i>When the Nylons Bloom</i>."  Betty Roch&eacute;'s singing is also mentioned in this review and they are both mentioned in <i>The Billboard</i>'s 1944-03-25 p.28 report of band grosses at the RKO-Boston.</li>

<li>Announcements of the forthcoming Hurricane engagement in the <i>Brooklyn Eagle</i> 1944-03-24 p.17, <i>The New York Sun</i>, 1944-03-27 p.19 and The Pittsburgh Courier 1944-04-01 all name Wini.</li>

<li><i>Variety</i>'s 1944-04-05 p.34 review of the Hurricane engagement says "<i>Ellington has put a new female singer with his four trumpet, three trombone, five sax, four rhythm group: she's Wini Johnson, an extremely attractive Negress who is only fair on voice.</i>"</li>

<li><i>The Pittsburgh Courier</i>'s 1944-04-08 review of the Hurricane show says <p class=bq>'Particular interest was centered on the newcomer to the Ellington aggregation, however, Miss Wini Johnson, who was making her New York night club debut as a singer.  Although she was nervous, the young singer gave a very good account of herself, and most of the time managed to convey the idea that she was cool as a cucumber.  Her voice is stronger and more developed than it has seemed at other times in her career, and seems well on the way to being a fine one.  Lovely to look at, Miss Johnson turns out to be 'the refreshing young personality' that Duke introduces her as.  Time will taper off the rough edges, and the young lady is well on her way to stardom.'</p></li>

<li><i>The Billboard</i>'s 1944-04-15 review of Ellington's Hurricane show says <p class=bq>'Wini Johnson contribs two numbers, <i>Shoo-Shoo Baby</i> and <i>When the Nylons Bloom Again</i> from the Stemusical [sic] <i>Early to Bed</i>, of which she is an alumna.  Gets over to a moderate reception. '</p></li>

<li><i>Timner V</i> shows Wini singing Everything But You with Marie Ellington in a broadcast from the Hurricane on 1944 05 28.

<p align=center>Miss Brown was about ten years younger than Wini Johnson, born in 1927 or 1928 and graduating from Englehart High School in Chicago.  Her singing career began with what seems to have been a short sojourn with the Eddie Mallory orchestra under the name Annabella.  She joined Lionel Hampton's band at age 18 in February 1946 as Winnie or Wini Brown. </p>

<p align=center>Winnie Brown sang with Hampton until mid-1948, leaving to marry his baritone sax player, Charlie Fowlkes. She entered into a recording contract with National in 1948, then in 1949 with Columbia Records.</p>
<p align=center>A detailed biography of <b>Wini Brown</b> and her recording history is posted in <a href=http://www.uncamarvy.com/WiniBrown/winibrown.html target=_blank>Marv Goldberg's Yesterday's Memories Rhythm & Blues Party website</a>. Mr. Goldberg found little information about her after 1961, but suggests she died in 1978.</p>
