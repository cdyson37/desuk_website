<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p style=font-size:0.75em;><b><i>Down Beat</i></b>, 1942-07-15, p. 31</p>
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p>Advising a young singer is the worst thing in the world &ndash; but here goes.</p>
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p>Acquire proper and distinct articulation.</p>
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p>Be neat of dress and of personal appearance.</p>
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p>Pick songs and arrangements suited to your voice and personality.</p>
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p>Take singing lessons and keep on as long as you can &ndash; provided you have
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar-->natural ability. From then on you're on your own.</p>
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p>Go out on the stage and do what's most natural for you. The only thing a
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar-->young singer can do is to do her best.</p>
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p>An amateur may sing beautifully, but her negative stage personality may more than offset her good voice.</p>
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p>Knowing or "typing" an audience immediately you walk out on a stage comes only with experience. So does timing.</p>
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p>Knowing your audience is practically a course in mass psychology. I used to "blow
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar-->up" easily. Now the roof can fall down and it won't even bother me.</p>
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p>If you're hoarse or have a cold, just sing the best you can.</p>
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p>Don't take it to heart if you don't get the applause you think you should.</p>
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p>Singers with bands don't usually take the rap if they flop. They just go out and
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar-->join another outfit. If they're pretty, they join a bigger band.</p>
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar--><p>Try to sing songs as if they were stories. Don't try to sell your voice &ndash;
<!-- Ivie's tips sidebar-->sell entertainment.</p>

<a name="disclaimer"></a><p>Disclaimer:<br>Some dates can only be estimated because the newspapers did not reliably date the events. An example is where Ivie's biography published August 4, 1934 says the author met Ivie Tuesday night. The Tuesday in question June 12, some eight weeks before publication.  Other ambiguities arise by delays in sharing stories between publications and press deadlines had to allow for weekly newspapers to be issued earlier in the week than the date would suggest.</p>

Some sources report Ivie joined Ellington in 1932 &ndash; that was when she made her first records with Duke. The summer before she left, Ivie and her soon-to-be second husband opened Ivie's Chicken Shack in Los Angeles, and later built a small apartment building.<br><br>Ivie continued to sing after leaving Ellington, and died prematurely on December 28, 1949.<br><br>Already well-established in show business before being hired by Ellington, Ivie is said to have started singing professionally in 1921 or 1922 and in 1923 she was in the tour companies of the revues "<i>Struttin' Along</i> and "<i>Shuffle Along</i>".  By 1925, she is said to have already performed in Cuba, New York (the Cotton Club) and Los Angeles with the Paul Howard, Curtis Mosby, and Sonny Clay bands. In 1928, she sang in Australia with Clay's band and returned to Los Angeles, playing in Frank Sebastian's Cotton Club and Curtis Mosby's Apex Nite Club. <!--Soon after, she began touring the U.S.A. as a solo singer. DROPPED  NO EVIDENCE FOUND--> Her name appears in the press at least two dozen times in 1928 and more than fifteen times in 1929 and early 1930, most often in the Afro-American papers <i>The California Eagle</i> and the <i>Chicago Defender</i>.

Her life, like her songs, was a medley, a puzzling mixture. She was born in Oklahoma and educated at a convent in California, and she was as sophisticated a singer as jazz has produced. She had had some serious vocal coaching and sang in night clubs and revues, including <i>Shuffle Along</i>. With her  neat coiffure, her impeccable clothes, her refined and delicate features, and her exquisite manner went an improper, rough voice, an impudent gesture, a sardonic smile that, in bewildering combination, tumbled audience after audience into her lap in the course of eleven years with Ellington. <br>&nbsp; ...She left the Duke in 1942, suffering from asthma, the condition which killed her seven years later at the age of forty-five. <br>&nbsp; After leaving Duke she worked irregularly; she made her final appearance in New York to raise the last few dollars necessary to buy an apartment house in Los Angeles, which was to have been her security...

<div class=bq>'...If singing was needed, before 1931, it was handled by drummer Sonny Greer or, on an occasional and reluctant basis, trumpeter Cootie Wiliams.  At the Cotton Club, where the orchestra accompanied a number of singers, the Ellingtonians had not needed their own, and relatively few of the other bands regularly featured singers.<br>&nbsp; But now, for stage shows on the road, Ellington decided to add a vocalist.  In Chicago he tested a singer named Ivie Anderson for <b>two</b> weeks, and then hired her.  Anderson, twenty-five [<i>sic</i>], had been sent over from the Grand Terrace by fellow bandleader Earl Hines... Though on stage she appeared almost angelic...  off stage she was quite another person, in the words of future band mate Rex Stewart, <q>bossing a poker game, cussing out Ellington, playing practical jokes are giving some girl advice about love and life.</q><br>&nbsp; ...Remaining with the orchestra for eleven years, Anderson became Ellington's most versatile singer.'

1904 04 23 and 1905 04 22.</li><li>I have not seen the 1901 marriage documents and <a href=http://tinyurl.com/y7dwmmfg target=_blank>The Louisiana Secretary of State website</a> says the law did not require birth records for parishes other than Orleans until 1918.</li><li>Mr. Glueckstein does not say if Silva divorced Jobe, if he died, or what happened to him.</li><li>The 1910 census shows Mr. and Mrs. Hunt had been  married two years, indicating a marriage between 1907 and 1908 if two years was anything but a rough estimate. Each member of the family is described as mulatto, and the entry for Ivie says she and both parents were born in Louisiana.</li>
<li>Silva's entry shows she had had two children, and one was still alive.</li>

<li> Mr. Glueckstein:<p class=bq>'A few years later, around 1913, Ivie and her mother were living in Gilroy, California.  Silva had

Webmaster's comments: <ul><li>The given name of this husband appears to be Issac rather than Isaac.</li><li>1913 needs to be confirmed, as well as the date Silva married Issac, since Mrs. Silva or Silvia Jones, age 26, of Chickasha married Johnie [sic] Roberts, age 25, of Oklahoma City on December 23, 1912 in Chickasha.</li>
<li>The marriage license application and the license itself are dated December 23.</li>
<li>The certificate, recorded on December 30, says they were married December 23.</li>
<li>"Silva" is written on the application for a marriage license, and "Silvia" is written
in the license itself.</li><li>Witnesses were Mrs. [sic] Anderson Moore and Mrs. Annie Moore
but they did not sign the document.</li>
<li>Since Mr. Glueckstein says Silva's sister Frances was known as Annie and her husband
was Anderson Moore, the "Mrs." preceding "Anderson Moore" seems to be a transcription
error by the clerk who filled in all three documents by hand.</li></ul>

<li> Mr. Glueckstein writes that Silva developed cancer and took Ivie to visit Annie (Frances) and her husband, Anderson (Moore) in 1916.  They stayed for a few months, before returning to Gilroy, with Silva on a cot. Silva died in December 1917.  Her funeral was at Antioch Baptist Church, of which Silva was a member, and she is interred at Oak Hill Cemetary in San Jose.

Anderson, birthplace Delaware, mother Sylvia [sic] Jones, birthplace Okla.</li><li style=padding:0 0 10px 0;>It was the first marriage for both.</li>
<li>Ivie's divorce complaint, filed 1941-10-17, stated that the couple separated in May 1928, there were no children and no community property... <!--An affidavit filed with the court, said <p class=bq>'Defendant was served with complaint and summons at Bullocks's Dept. Store [a swank store in downtown L.A.] where he is presently employed.-->'</p> It says Ivie had known the defendant since 1922, and had last seen him in 1940.</p></li>
<li>An "Interlocutory Judgement of Divorce" was granted 1941-11-25 with a one-year waiting period. Steven Lasker:<p class=bq>'
The "Final Judgement of Divorce" of Ivie Anderson Johnson (Plaintiff) vs. William Johnson (Defendant) was "done in open court" on 1942-12-04, filed on 1942-12-07 (if I read it correctly), entered on 1942-12-08 and docketed on 1942-12-10.'</p>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li><b>Was Ivie a mother?</b><ul>
<li>As noted, Burley's June 1934 column said Ivie had a daughter</li>
<li>An August 1934 gossip item in <i>The Indianapolis Recorder</i> said she had a fourteen-year-old daughter attending high school in Los Angeles.</li><li>The Afro-American, 1937-10-23 p.4:
<p class=bq>'Poinsetta [sic] Moore, dotter [sic] of Ivy Anderson, songstress with Duke Ellington's crew, is a student at Howard.'</p></li>
<li>The Afro-American, 1949-12-31 p.2:
<p class=bq>'Miss Anderson was married to William Johnson, former football player of the University of Nebraska.  They separated in 1928.  A daughter was born during his [sic] union.'</p></li>
<li>The 1930 census has an 11-year-old girl, Pleasetta Moore, living in Ivie's household as her cousin, but Pleasetta's death record in the United States Social Security death register index (1990) says her parents were Anderson Moore and Annie F. Jones. In the 1920 census, Anderson and Annie's household in Chickasha, Ok. had two children, Willie, age 7 and Plesetta or Plyetta, age 2 1/12, this age being inconsistent with an age of 11 in the 1930 census.</li>
<li>Other than the mentions in the newspapers, which are notoriously unreliable, we have seen no evidence that Ivie had a child.  If she did, and if the child was 14 in 1934, she would have been born between 1919 and 1920.</li></ul>

<li>Bacon and Anderson had ample opportunity to get to know each other when Bacon
toured and recorded with Ellington in the period from September 1933 into the first
days of 1934. They were much in love by the end of that year according to the <i>
Pittsburgh Courier</i> in 1934:<p class=bq>'Backstage with Duke Ellington and his ork. Friday afternoon [1934-10-05] at the Apollo, we find Ivie Anderson as much in love with Louis (Fess Williams) Bacon as ever.'</p></li>

<li>Reports that Ivie Anderson was also Mrs. Louis Bacon weren't true. According to

<li>Bacon left America to join the Willie Lewis orchestra in the summer of 1939, and was in Europe after the fall of France. <i>Down Beat</i> wondered as to his status, incidentally noting that he was Ivie's husband.

<ul><li>Ivie met Marque Neal in 1940 according to his testimony in litigation ongong between them after her death.</li>
<li>After he moved from New York to California in 1941, they opened a restaurant named Ivie's Chicken Shack and sold it in 1944.</li>
<li>Ivie married Marque in 1942 before her divorce from Johnson was legally effective.</li>
<li>Steven Lasker:
<p class=bq>'Claire Gordon and Patricia Willard have both told me that Neal was well-liked by Ellington's men.'</p></li>

<li>In her 1948 lawsuit against Neal, Ivie claimed:<ul><li>She sold the house she owned at 756 E. 52nd Place in 1946, with the net proceeds of $2,900 and deferred payments of $1,000 deposited into their joint savings account.</li><li>Before they married, she owned two duplexes at 4218 San Pedro St. In 1946 Marque suggested her money wasn't earning much interest and that it would be better to sell and remove the two duplexes and build an apartment building to provide more income and provide security for her future.</li><li>She sold the buildings and her car for total net proceeds of $4,200, deposited in their joint savings account.</li><li>On May 31 1946 she signed documents at the Pacific Construction Company offices after the plans, specifications and contract for the apartment building were ready.</li></ul></li>

<li>Steven Lasker fleshed this out a bit:
<p class=bq>'Court records document that Ivie, previous to her marriage to Neal, had purchased a parcel of land at
4218 S. San Pedro Street, Los Angeles, on which stood two duplexes. These structures were sold and removed, and in their
place (but with a new address: 259 E. 41st Place), an apartment building christened the "Nealander" was constructed in
the spring of 1946...The building still stands, and can be viewed on <a href=http://tinyurl.com/y8l3naqk target=_blank>Google Maps "streetview."</a> (If you zoom in at either side of the building's front, or on either of the building's sides, you'll see, halfway up, small cut-metal signs that spell out "Nealander.")'</p></li>
<li>In reporting her death, <i>Los Angeles Times</i> said the address was 259 E. 41st Place.  The initial <i>Los Angeles Sentinel</i> report gave the same address, but its Dec. 29 edition (page A-2) located it a block south, at 42nd and San Pedro. The ANP wirestory in <i>Black Dispatch</i> gave the address as 659 E. 43rd St., about half a mile southeast.</li>
<li>The Nealander was Ivie's home when she died. She and Marque moved into one of the apartments in 1946, but it isn't clear which unit. We initially thought it was the ground floor unit at the east end, but in 2017 the building's property manager told David Palmquist that he thought it may have been the upper unit, which is much bigger and nicer than the others. The building was run-down when its current owner acquired it, but has been renovated and is now mainly used for social housing.</li>
<li>In 1948 Ivie petitioned the Superior Court to annul her marriage to Neal on the grounds it was ineffective since her marriage to Johnson was not yet dissolved when she married Neal. Steven Lasker advises the decree of annulment was signed by the Superior Court on Aug. 23, 1948.</li>

<li>Marque Neal's answer to Ivie's initial legal complaint over the Nealander (filed 1948-09-17) noted: "defendant admits that plaintiff and defendant were intermarried in the State of Arizona on or about the 1st day of May 1942."</li>
<li>According to a 1949-09-28 filing by the plaintiff ("First Amended Complaint for Declaratory Relief, to Impress a Trust, Partition, Quiet Title and for an Accounting"), "the plaintiff married the said defendant during April of 1942.</li>
<li>According to the court's "Second Amended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law" filed 1950-10-19, "It is true that Marque Neal and Ivie Anderson did, on the 11th day of May, 1942, in the State of Arizona, enter into a marriage contract prior to the final judgement of divorce between William Johnson and Ivie Anderson that was signed in the court and entered December 4, 1942."</li>

<li>A report in the <i>California Eagle</i> (1942-07-24) shortly after the restaurant opened makes clear that Neal was the principal investor:<p class=bq>"It's nice to see a swell guy like Marcus [sic] Neal on top of the heap, as his Chicken Shack with Ivie Anderson's name in the electric light sign, will be a big draw."</p></li><li>In subsequent litigation, the court found that Neal <p class=bq>"opened a restaurant known as 'Ivie's Chicken Shack' with his personal funds and that he operated the restaurant from about June 13, 1941, until it was sold about November 20, 1944; that the proceeds from the sale thereof and profits from its operation were deposited in the joint savings account [held by Marque Neal and Ivie]."</p></li>
<li>ANP wirestory (The Indianapolis Recorder 1948-08-21 p.13):<p class=bq>'LOS ANGELES (ANP) &ndash; Ivie Anderson,... reached a property settlement in the annulment action with her husband, Marque Neal, last week.

<li>Steven Lasker:<!--2017-09-27--><p class=bq>'Marque Neal was served at the Nealander with a summons to answer an annulment compaint from Ivie Johnson aka Ivie Neal on 1948-05-14. Marque Neal, the defendant, failed to answer the complaint within the 10-day period prescribed by law. Judge Ingall W. Bull issued a "Judgement of Annulment of Void Marriage (Default)" on 1948-08-20 that was filed with the County Clerk three days later.'</p></li>
<li>The California Eagle 1948-10-21 p.4:<p class=bq>'... Miss Anderson who filed the suit under the name of Ivie Neal through her attorney Walter L. Gordon, Jr., has just recently secured an annulment of her marriage to Neal approximately two months ago ...In this present action, Miss Anderson asserts that she and Neal married May 1, 1942, and lived together until August 20, 1948...'</p></li>
</li>
<li>The following articles report on the lawsuits:
<ul><li>Chicago Defender, Chicago, Ill., 1950-01-07 p.1 reported Neal began an action more than a year previously over ownership of their apartment building. This was incorrect; Ivie initiated the lawsuit.  Steven Lasker:<p class=bq>'The "Nealander suit" entered the court system on 1948-09-07, when Ivie Neal, Plaintiff, filed a complaint vs. Marque Neal seeking "Quiet Title, Establish Trust, and Partition of Real Property." '</p></li>
<li>An ANP wirestory in Black Dispatch, 1950-01-21 pp.1,2 said  Neal and Collins were in litigation over Ivie's substantial ($75,000) estate.  The article seems to indicate this was a second lawsuit, since it also mentions Neal's suit over the apartment block.</li>
<li>Chicago Defender, Chicago, Ill., 1950-01-21 p.1 speculated the court fight might not come off because Neal and his lawyer had found a 1946 joint tenancy deed giving survivorship rights to Neal.</li></li>
<li>Los Angeles Sentinel, Los Angeles, Cal. 1950-06-29 pp.A-1,A-2 reported the judge had decided the case in favour of Neal.</li>

When <a title="female performer playing a lively, flirtatious role in a play or opera.">the soubrette</a> of the show fell ill, Ivie got her chance; and she stepped in to fill the spot on an hour's notice. This led to her work as a soubrette with the <i>Shuffle Along</i> musicale, to work at Sebastian's Cotton Club, in a five [sic] months' tour of Australia with a Fanchon & Marco unit, and finally to heading her own revue on the West Coast for a 20-week stretch. She even sang with Anson Weeks' band at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco.<br>&nbsp; And so, by 1930, when she began  <a title="20-weeks according to the article">her engagement</a> at the <a title="in Chicago">Grand Terrace</a>, she already was a seasoned performer. But it was the unique combination of Ellington <i>and</i>  Anderson which was to bring Ivie recognition and acclaim, not only of the profession, but of the public as well. She was the first singer ever to join a colored band as part of the regular organization, missing by only a year the record established by <a title="white singer, cousin of George Gershwin">Fritzi White</a>, who will be remembered as the vocalist who joined <a title="white 'hotel' bandleader">George Hall</a> late in 1929.

<ul><li>"Struttin' Along"</a> featured Mamie Smith and her Jazz Houn's with "Creole Beauties Chorus."  The first all-black revue to play the West Coast, publicity describes it as fashioned along the lines of "Shuffle Along" and "Strut, Miss Lizzie." It was advertised as having a company of 75, but some reviews during its tour say 60, and in Petaluma, the paper said 59.</li><li>The producers brought about 40 members of the company from the East Coast; the show may have played in the East or Midwest before opening in San Francisco and a show of the same name is found in 1924 newspapers, but these are beyond the scope of this webpage.</li>
<li>After playing San Francisco for seven weeks, "<i>Struttin' Along</i>" toured California, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Idaho until June, travelling by rail in Pullman coaches.  Gaps in the following chronology may be due to a lack of bookings, or simply from the absence of newspapers for some of locations toured in the archives of Newspapers.com, Newspaperarchives.com, Genealogybank.com, Fultonhistory.com, Archive.org, <span class=nobr>Lantern.mediahist.org</span> (Variety) and <span class=nobr>news.google.com/newspapers.</span> Searching ProQuest, not available to this writer, will likely turn up more dates.</li>

<li><i>Variety</i> 1927-11-16 p.2<p class=bq>'AUSTRALIA Sydney, Oct. 15<br>&nbsp; Harry Muller has booked a colored show to appear at the Tivoli, Sydney, early in the new year.  The company will include Sonny Clay's Band, Dick Saunders, Ivy Anderson, Four Covans, with the Emperors of Harmony (colored act now on circuit) as added attraction.  Unit will occupy the whole of the second half of show.'</p><br></li>
<li><i>The Afro-American</i>, Baltimore, Md. 1927-12-17 p.8<p class=bq>'LOS ANGELES, Calif.&ndash; Sonny Clay and his orchestra, the Four Covans, Ivy Anderson, Dick Saunders, and the Four Emporers of Song, are scheduled to sail from here for Australia, Thursday, December 29, where they will play over the Williamson Circuit.  The act will open early in February.'</p><br></li>
<li>The poster reproduced on the cover of <a href=http://tinyurl.com/Storyville061 target=_blank><i>Storyville</i> 61 (Oct./Nov.1975)</a> <span style="font: 0.9em small-caps;">(courtesy Ken Steiner)</span>, bills Ivy as "Ivy Anderson Colored Comedienne." <i>Storyville</i> says the American group numbered 41, including the Sonny Clay band, dancers and singers. They landed in Sydney January 21 and opened that day at its  Tivoli Theatre. On February 18 ["to-day" per <i>The Age</i>, Melbourne, 1928-02-18 p.17] reported it opened at the Tivoli in Melbourne where <i>Storyville</i> says Ivy won the dressing room craps games. The Sydney engagement was
advertised daily in the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, Sydney, January 18 through February 15 and the Melbourne appearance was advertised daily in <i>The Age</i> from Feb. 15 to March 24.<br><br></li>
<li><i>Variety</i> 1928-02-29 p.2<p class=bq>'AUSTRALIA Sydney, Jan. 28:<br>&nbsp; A sweltering afternoon found this theatre jammed for the Australian premiere of Sonny Clay and his orchestra, together with a company of colored dancers and singers.  Harry Muller booked the attraction in America.  On opening it looked as thought the troupe needed a little more rehearsing, but all the tunes offered are brand new here.  It would have been better if the boys had interspersed a couple of melodies more favorably known.<br>&nbsp; Four Covans did nicely with their stepping and Ivy Anderson, soubret, did fairly well.  Dick Saunders, as m.c., proved disappointing in this respect.  The colored unit takes up the entire second half of the bill.  Vaudeville supplied by Armstrong and Phelps, Hector St. Clair, the Cavanaghs,
and Davy Jamieson fills in first half of the show.'</p><br></li>
<li>In advertisements for the show in <i>The Age</i> (1928-03-19 p.20, 1928-03-23 p.16 and 1928-03-24 p.24), Ivy is described as "America's Cleverest Colored Comedienne."  The March 24 ads say "Last Nights and Farewell of Sonny Clay's Colored Idea."<br><br></li>
<li>The musicians, evicted from hotels for noise, rented two flats in an apartment building. After they were seen socializing with white women who were also seen in their building, the police, accompanied by a reporter, raided the apartments the last weekend of March.  The paper printed <a href=http://tinyurl.com/ybk4vxtw target=_blank>a lurid, racist account of the raid</a>. <i>Storyville</i> says the public uproar resulted in the matter being raised in Parliament.  The ladies, charged with vagrancy, all had jobs and were found not guilty.  The six men were not charged
but were deported and the other musicians were forced to leave as well. It appears the entire company left Australia on March 31.<br><br></li>
<li>Steven Lasker:<div class=bq>Per Herbert E. Walker, <i>Chicago Defender</i> nat'l ed., 1935-02-09: <p class=bq>'The Australians [in 1928] went wild over her voice. Here was a pretty girl who could sing naughty songs nice, and make nice songs naughty without losing her woman's dignity. Her voice and winning personality made her a [illegible] brown-skin idol. She [was] flooded with marriage proposals from guys who were big shots in the eyes of the islanders. The more aloof she was to these proposals the better they liked her. She had as gifts a dozen kangaroos, ranging from babies on up. '</p></div><br></li>

Mosby is the man that had made something go where others had failed.  Curtis stuck at the game and worked hard. His wonderful band stuck by him in the lean days and helped the headsman click. Beyond a doubt Curtis has the best dance band on the Pacific Coast and it gets better every week...<br>&nbsp; Now to get down to the big show that came off Friday night.<br>&nbsp; First Curis had one of the biggest houses the Apex has ever had the pleasure of enjoying...By the time things were getting under way they were standing along the side lines, so to speak...<br>&nbsp;  The show wouldn't be complete if Ivy Anderson didn't star.  The little high brown mama can sing and sing and sing some more and the more you hear her sing the more you want to hear her stretch her neck and let those sweet notes come forth.  Oh how that gal can warble.  "Am I Blue" is her speciality and she knocks them down and around and every other way when she lets Ethel Waters' number go.  Personally I think the High Brown has Ethel backed off the map.  That's taking nothing from Miss Waters, because she is good but to this writer, Miss Ivy Anderson, Curtis Mosby's star performer has not seen her peer as yet. And that's that, I'll get plenty of this and that, but I stand by my convictions'</li></ul>

<b>Fox 'Radio Reel'Continues Popular</b><br>&nbsp; The Saturday Midnight "Radio Revel" staged every week at the Fox Theater, continues with unabated popularity. Tonight's program will include, among others, William Powers, the singer of negro spirituals over KPO and KGO; Hazel Warner, a Kirec [sic] star, and Ivy Anderson, a <i>KFl</i> favorite star from Los Angeles. These stage programs, started over two months ago as an experiment at the Fox, have proved a surprising attraction. The performance begins at 11:30, but the radio talent does not appear until after midnight. In addition to radio stars the program will contain the complete Fox Theater,show, including Vilma Banky in her first all-dialogue film,"A Lady to Love,"
Fanchon and Marco's " Broadway Venus" and Wal Roesner's orchestra playing the stirring "William Ten [sic] Overture."</li></ul></td>

I wondered why, without challenging the decision (since they were paying), and soon I learned that Ivie was chosen because she was of darker skin.  Well, I am one of those people who never consider color important.   What was important in this instance was the sound and ability of the singer... <br>&nbsp; They still talk about Ivie, and every girl singer we've had since has had to try to prevail over the Ivie Anderson image.

<li> Steven Lasker:<div class=bq>Per Paul Eduard Miller, <i>ibid.</i>:
<p class=bq>'  Ivie frankly admits her indebtedness to Ellington.<br>&nbsp; "For example, when I first started with the Duke," she recalls, "I used to wear colored dresses. When he suggested I wear only white, I tried it out and found it so effective that I've been doing it ever since. And for another thing, Duke helped me tremendously in molding my style of singing. When I joined his band I was just an ordinary singer of popular songs. Duke suggested I find a 'character' and maintain it. What's more, he's a leader who believes in taking a lot of time and trouble to find the right background for his singer. He's always supplied me with ideal accompaniment, one which suited the 'character' which I adopted. The combination of these two things resulted in the type of songs I'm still doing today.<br>&nbsp; "The first one I sang that way was <i>Minnie the Moocher</i>, when the boys in the band worked out the idea of talking back to me while I was singing. <i>I Want a Man</i> is another of this type. And I'll never forget the first record I made -- <i>It Don't Mean a Thing if It Ain't Got that Swing</i>  &ndash; one of Duke's own hit tunes and one which helped greatly to identify me in the character of my songs to this very day. Duke knows how to write arranged accompaniments that fit my voice perfectly, and I think that's why I'm more contented now than I've ever been."<br>&nbsp; We all know the 'character' in which Ivie sings. When she walks out on a stage her appearance is serene dignity. Poised, with an almost serious expression on her diminutive face, she confronts her audience with a deceptive demeanor. A seasoned and judicious showman, she knows just how to make the most of the marked contrast between her appearance and the abandoned, low-down quality of her vocalisms.'</p></div><br>

<li>Philadelphia Tribune, 1931-03-05:<p class=bq>'...Plain of dress and manner, she opened with the Duke at the Oriental Theatre when he first struck town. Her song was that inimitable success of the late Florence Mills, "<i>I'm a Little Blackbird [Looking for a Bluebird]</i>." When the little girl finished "chirping" the words of that memorable bit of sentimentality, the white folks went wild. Time and again she came back for a bow and was finally forced to make a neat little excuse, promising the raving fans that she would appear later in the Duke's stage show. She did, but only in the finale.<br><br>&nbsp; She created the same impression when Duke and his boys went to the Regal Theatre in the colored district. <br><br>&nbsp; As she is singing one of the songs which contributed to the popularity and success of Miss Mills, the temptation to compare the two is inevitable. The general conclusion is that Miss Anderson has everything Miss Mills had except quality of voice and a finished daintiness. The voice of Miss Mills was bell-like and tinkling. That of Miss Anderson is more like the voice of Ethel Waters. But she had the same interpretative talent Miss Mills possessed, a personality that is even more sparkling and at dancing she is what the reviewers call a wow.<br><br>&nbsp; At any rate, she started two weeks ago as a sort of unknown. But today Miss Anderson is being billed right along with the Duke himself. She has made herself a selling attraction. As Duke's entourage moved from the Regal to the Uptown Theatre with its 5,000 seats, somebody with an idea about things worked the name of Miss Anderson into the advertisements and lights.'</p><br></li>

Ivy, against the wishes of her relatives, went down for an addition and went out with the show called the "Plantation Revue," for 10 weeks.  Mamie Smith was the star of the show.<br>&nbsp; Her people raised "Old Ned." But Ivy tasted the glamor of colored lights, sound of thunderous applause.  She appeared with " Strutting Along," delete the lead, featuring the song " Nothing Could Be Finer Than to Be in Carolina In the Morning." She teamed with Susie Hurst in a duo and also sang "Aggravating Papa," her first speciality and loan.  She joined the second edition of "Shuffle Along" in 1923 show [sic].<br>&nbsp; There she worked with Lucky Rogers in "Strutting Time" and in Connie's Inn road show for about six months.  She went out with Malinda and Dade, a sepia RKO hit and in 1924 went into the Cotton club as an act.  She was soubrette with" Brownskin Vamps"...    '</p></li>

A yearning born of intense desire to be one of those glamorous personages whom people paid good coin to see and whose pictures appeared in all the papers.  Yet it all seemed so fantastic and so impossible for a little nobody.  She worried herself nearly sick, wondering how people ever got that way, and she trudged home with heavy heart, to propare her typing lessons......there would be school tomorrow.<br>&nbsp; That was some twelve years ago back in a town called Gilroy, Califormia.  But twelve years is sufficient to change a person's outlook as well as environment.  It has done even more to Ivy Anderson...now she's a vivacious little star [...]  <br>&nbsp; She was on her way to school one day when a friend [...] told her there were two show people in town who were looking for talent.  Ivy couldn't dance, and she had never tried to sing, yet she was thrilled at the news her friend broke [...]<br>&nbsp; Fanchon and Marco [...] happened to be the producers in need of talent.  Ivy vowed she'd give them something they'd remember....and she did. Fanchon and Marco had never seen a girl cut such furious capers... yet she possessed a personality that interested and they assigned her to the chorus of their new show.  To Ivy Anderson, that was that.. she had at least gained a tiny footing...she was thrilled.[...]The only comment she makes on the sensation she causes wherever she sings comes in a few quiet words:<br>&nbsp; "I love to sing," she smiles.  "I am terribly happy when I make others happy by singing to them."<br>&nbsp; Late in 1922 some wise guy with Shuffle Along then playing on the coast, spotted Ivy and induced her to accompany the show to New York.  Following in a swift whirl were engagements at the Cotton club and other Harlem show spots.  Later, in 1924, came bookings in Cuba.  She was called back to America to fill engagements in the Middle West and California.  Fanchon and Marco finding her on the coast again, sent her to Australia to head a production.  The Australians went wild over her voice...<br>&nbsp; Ivy came back to Los Angeles in April of 1928 to star in the Cotton Club there...the Apex of Los Angeles also saw some of her services then.<br>&nbsp; ...The one great she idolizes is Ethel Waters.  When asked if she had ever been compared with Ethel Waters, Ivy replied, <br>&nbsp; "She is an artist.  I am merely an entertainer who has been unusually lucky."

Per: District Court of Appeal of the State of California Second Appellate District, Division Two, Walter Collins, Administrator of the Estate of Ivie Collins, AKA Ivie Anderson, Deceased (substituted in lieu of Ivie Neal, aka Ivie Anderson, Deceased), Plaintiff and Appellant, vs. Marque Neal, Hollywood Saving and Loan Associatiom, a corporation Defendant and Respondent<br>
APPEAL from judgement of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County and purported appeal from order denying new trial. Walter Evans, Judge. Judgement affirmed. Appeal from order dismissed. Filed Dec. 3, 1951.<br>
THE COURT...:[page 5: "Ivie Anderson was a professional singer; he [Marque Neal] acted as her manager and accompanied her on at least three tours; there were periods of time when she was not working; one year she worked only nine weeks and another but four weeks; at various times when she was on tour she sent home to him sums of money which represent her salary less her expenses and these funds were deposited in their joint account [....]"</li>
<li>In a separate list attached to an "Affidavit for Subpoena" filed 3/31/50, details of $11,515 in money orders purchased by Ivie on the road and payable to Marque Neal at Los Angeles were itemized. The information was provided by the manager of the main L.A. office of Western Union in response to a subpoena and offer a glimpse into Ivie's tour schedule and how much she was able to send home after expenses. (The cities listed are those of the Western Union offices where Ivie purchased the money orders, and aren't necessarily the cities where Ivie worked.)

<hr style="margin:5em 0; border-width:2px; border-style:ridge;">
<div style=font-size:0.9em; font-style:small-caps;>
<p>This webpage started because my research colleague and Ellington expert Steven Lasker noticed <a href=http://tdwaw.ca target=_blank>The Duke - Where and When</a> had Ivie joining Ellington a day early. As I went through the webpage to try to figure out why I had the wrong date, I decided there was so much about Ivie scattered throughout the chronicle that it would be better if she had her own dedicated webpage.  And it grew from there, as a collaboration combining ongoing research by Steven, by Ken Steiner and by me.
<br><br>
Ivie is fascinating. To the best of my knowledge, her early career has not previously been documented, nor has a lot been written about her personal life or her post-Ellington years.<br><br>Questions, particularly related to her childhood and teen years, remain and hopefully we'll be able to fill in details as they are discovered.</p>
