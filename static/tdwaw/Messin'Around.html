<H2>The Messin' Around Revue of 1926</H2>
<br><br>
<p>The "Messin' Around Revue of 1926" was staged by Leonard Harper, with authors reported to be Roy Turk and Maceo Pinkard.</p>
<p>A.H. Lawrence: Duke Ellington and His World, p.45:</p>
<p class=blockquote>"The first week of June, 'Happy' Rhone, a Harlem night club owner, booked the band for a series of one-night stands in Connecticut. And Charlie Shribman, the band's old friend, signed the group for another tour of New England beginning in July. In the interim, Leonard Harper arranged for the band to be part of the show Messin' Around at the Plantation Café. With a score by Maceo Pinkard and James P. Johnson, Messin' Around was typical of The Plantation's elaborate productions. Ellington led the band during its featured spot in the show, but the overall musical direction was left in the capable hands of the violinist-conductor, Ellsworth Reynolds."</p>
<p>The revue's name advertised in the 1926-06-02 New York Telegram was <strong><i>Messin' Around Revue of 1926</i></strong>.</p>
<p>The opening date is per Ken Steiner's research published in his 2008 Ellington conference paper, <cite>Wild Throng Dances Madly in Cellar Club, Duke Ellington and the Washingtonians 1923-27</cite>, pp.28-29, in which he reproduced a Morning Telegraph revue published <a title="Thanks, Joe Medjuck, for catching my typo!">1926-05-27</a>, consistent with a May 25 opening.</p>
<p>The show was reviewed in the New York Telegram 1926-05-27 p.16, and Variety, 1926-06-09, carried a review by Abel Green, dated June 3 (reprinted in the Pittsburgh Courier 1926-06-26).</p>
<br>
<p>Ellington's engagement was incorrectly reported to have been after the October 1927 Jazzmania revue in:</p> <div class=blockquote>

<li>Mark Tucker: <br><cite><strong>Ellington The Early Years</strong></cite>, pp.208-209:
<blockquote><q>"During October the Washingtonians performed for the revue Messin' Around, which was presented at the Plantation Café in the Winter Garden building.  It was a gathering of old friends: Leonard Harper staged the show, and Maceo Pinkard wrote the music."</q></blockquote> At page 305 note 51, Dr. Tucker wrote:<blockquote><q> "The only source for this is Ellsworth Reynold's scrapbook.  See Dutton, "Birth of a Band," Part 1, pp. 52-53; Part 2, p.10."</q></blockquote>  and at p.309:<blockquote><q>"The single most helpful article for this study was a four-part series by Frank Dutton entitled Birth of A Band that appeared in the British periodical Storyville from 1979 to 1983"</q>.</blockquote><br><br></li>

<blockquote><q>"..they performed for three weeks at Club Ciro's.  They then landed engagements in three reviews combining song, dance, and comedy.  The first, in mid-October, was held at Harlem's Lafayette Theater, about two blocks from Ellington's apartment.  The review was called Jazzmania ... The second revue, in October, was Messin' Around, at the Plantation Club.  Third, in November, was Dance Mania, back at the Lafayette..."</q></blockquote>Dr. Hasse's book does not identify the source of this information. His notes for page 95 only mention Jazzmania and Dance Mania.

<li>John Franceschina:<br><cite><strong>Duke Ellington's Music for the Theater</strong></cite>, p.205 note 9:
<blockquote>, <q>"Between Chocolate Kiddies and Ellington's tenure at the Cotton Club, the Washingtonians took to the stage of the Lafayette Theatre where they did double duty, playing in the pit and on stage, for Clarence Robinson's revue Jazzmania, beginning 10 October 1927.   They followed this with a performance in Messin' Around, another October revue produced at the Plantation Café in the Winter Garden Building.  By mid-November, the band was back at the Lafayette Theatre, performing in Dance Mania..."</q></blockquote>Professor Franceschina confirmed he relied on <i>Tucker</i>.<br><br></li>

<p>According to Steven Lasker, <i>The Washingtonians: A Miscellany</i></p>
<p class=blockquote>"Violinist Ellsworth Reynolds was in the band during the spring of 1926 and again in the fall of 1927 and early winter of 1927-28. He left several recollections of his days with Ellington in the form of an article for Jazz Monthly (Feb 67, p5) and unpublished letters, often factually incorrect and even contradictory but nonetheless fascinating, to Frank Driggs (undated), Peter Carr (17Dec76) and Frank Dutton (15Jul78). In the last-mentioned letter, Reynolds noted: 'I joined Duke here in N.Y. 1926 -- his 1st attempt to enlarge his band for a stint for the Club Ciro Revue. ... After the Club Ciro date, we went to the Plantation Club on B'way....'"</p>
<p>Dutton initially dated the Plantation gig as October 1927, evidently based on this letter from Reynolds, and the fall 1927 date appeared in "Birth of a Band" in the December 1978 Storyville magazine. Mr. Dutton invited comments on his research, and in the October 1980 issue, corrected the date to "late June 1926."</p>
<p>The dating clearly puzzled the late Gordon Ewing as he carried on with the <a href=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/wghtml/ellington.html target=_blank>Joe Igo itinerary</a>. In DEMS 1991-1 Mr. Ewing asked:</p><br><br>
<div=blockquote><img width=500px margin-left=300px src=http://ellingtonweb.ca/Hostedpages/TDWAW/TheDukeEllingtonChronicleIgoItineraryQueries.png><br><br>(source: <a href=http://depanorama.net/dems/1991-1-DEMS-Bulletin.pdf target=_blank>DEMS 1991-1</a>)<br></div> 

<p>Barry Ulanov's Ellington biography, published in 1946, says</p>
<p class=blockquote>"The band was playing at The Plantation then, ... But the Plantation wasn't paying off, so, after a delay on the first week's pay, and no pay at all the second, the Washingtonians left..."</p>
<p>This appears to be based on a Joe Nanton interview in Metronome in February 1945:</p>
<p class=blockquote><q>When Duke came and asked me to play in the band I didn't want to go because he was offering me my friend's job. 'He'll be back next week,' I said. Duke insisted. I promised to join him, but I didn't show up. The following night Duke came by and asked why I didn't come in. This time he waited until I got dressed and he TOOK me with him. He was playing at the Plantation then, at Fiftieth and Broadway. The first week I had to wait two days for my pay and the second week there wasn't any pay. So the place closed and we went to New England...</q></p>
<p>The show clearly ran more than two weeks, because it was broadcast on June 17 and Variety listed it under Cabaret Bills until July 14.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the TDWAW itinerary, we assume a July 11 closing date simply because that is the last day before the band went to New England. No ads after June 20 have been found at the time of writing although it seems unlikely a show would be advertised after it closed unless the ad was paid for in advance.</p>
<p>Other corroboration</p>
<ul style=margin-left=450px;>
<li>The June 17 broadcast confirms the revue was playing in mid-June.</li> 
<li>Pittsburgh Courier 1926-06-19 p.10 says Leonard Harper's 'Messing Around,' the present revue at Plantation, New York City, is declared to be the hottest thing in Gotham, but it seems likely to have ended by 1926-07-10 when the New York Age, 1926-07-10 p.6 said Leonard Harper presents the Ciro Revue at the Lincoln Theatre, New York City.</li>
<li>Variety's cabaret listings would seem to show the engagement lasted into mid-July.</li>
<li>Joe Nanton (later nicknamed Tricky Sam) was hired during the engagement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Works with similar names:</p>
<ul style=margin-left=450px;>
<li>Messin' Around, by Johnny St. Cyr and Charles L. "Doc" Cooke, recorded by Cookie's Gingersnaps 1926-06-22</li>
<li>Messin' Around by Jimmy Blythe, recorded by Jimmy Blythe and His Ragamuffins</li>
<li>In 1929, a musical theatre production "Messin' Around," credited to Johnson (as Jimmy Johnson) and Perry Bradford opened on Broadway at the Hudson Theatre on April 22, and played 33 performances.</li>
<li>Various newspapers mention a dance by the same name in the mid-1920s.</li>
</ul>




<h2 align=center>When was the Revue?</h2>
<br>
<p>Ken Steiner, in his Ellington 2008 conference paper, <cite>Wild Throng Dances Madly in Cellar Club, Duke Ellington and the Washingtonians 1923-27</cite>, at page 28, says the revue ran from May 25, 1926 to late June or early July 1926.</p>   

<p>I have so far been unable to find any evidence of a revue in late 1927 called "Messin' Around."   On the other hand, news reports and reviews in 1926 show "Duke Ellington's Washingtonians" played in "Messin' Around Revue of 1926" which began May 25, 1926 at the Plantation.</p> 

<h2 align=center>How long was the engagement?</h2>
<p>Ellington biographer Barry Ulanov, in <cite>Duke Ellington</cite>, Creative Age Press, Incorporated, 1946, wrote <q>The band was playing at The Plantation then, ... But the Plantation wasn't paying off, so, after a delay on the first week's pay, and no pay at all the second, the Washingtonians left..."</q>  

<p>Research by Steven Lasker and Ken Steiner shows the revue began May 25, 1926.  The closing date is uncertain, but the show was listed in Variety's Cabaret Bills section until July 14.</p><br>  

<H3>Documentation</H3>
<p>In <i>Wild Throng Dances Madly in Cellar Club</i>, pp.28-29, Ken reproduced a <i>Morning Telegraph</i> 1926-05-27 revue, which is consistent with an opening on May 25. Ken's support for May 25 to late June/early July7 is well-documented in "<i>Wild Throng</i>",  including:

    <ul>
    <li>Ad, New York Telegram 1926-06-02 for "Messin' Around Revue of 1926" at The Plantation, at 50th Street and Broadway.</li> 
    <li>Review, Morning Telegraph 1926-06-02</li>
    <li>Commentary, Morning Telegraph 1926-06-07, p.8</li>
    <li>Story, Morning Telegraph 1926-06-09, p.8</li>
    <li>Comment, Morning Telegraph 1926-06-16</li>
    <li>Morning Telegraph 1926-06-18, p.10</li>
    <li>Morning Telegraph 1926-06-19, p.5</li>
    <li>Morning Telegraph 1926-06-20, p.7, s3</li>
    <li>Morning Telegraph 1926-06-29</li>
    </ul>

<p>May 25 1926 is reasonably consistent with A.H. Lawrence, Duke Ellington and His World, p.45.

<p>The show was still running June 17, since it was broadcast that evening.   I have tentatively assumed an unconfirmed closing date of July 11, subject to receiving documentation to the contrary.  This date is simply the last day before the band went to New England, and is consistent with Variety, which Mr. Steiner says continued to list the revue in "Cabaret Bills" until July 14.   On the other hand, Harper's next revue was announced on July 10, so...</p>

<p>I have been unable to find any support for an October 1927 performance of this show.
